# planificatorNutritional
Meal Planner that generates random meals based on specific diets and user data/input

By using this app a user can create an account, specify his allergies and information such as gender, age, height and weight.
He can then specify a target weight, the number of meals he is planning to eat in one day or a specific diet (keto, vegetarian, maintenance, intermittent fasting etc.) 
and the app will generate his daily menu.
The user has the option to "Randomize" another meal if he wants to or can specify a custom amount of calories he wants to consume that day
so the app will generate a meal according to his tastes. Here he will be able to visualise his macronutirent ratios throught interactive charts
that can switch between macronutrient percentages and macronutrient calories.
The user will be able to view his daily progress starting from the day he signed up by visiting the "Progress" page.
If the user has the Admin role, he will have access to the "Manage Users" page where he observe details about existing users and can disable or 
re-enable their access to the app.
The role of "Nutritionist" can also be added - he will only view the users that have signed up to him and cand adjust their diets accordingly
